# 4 Years of TDD

## the good, the bad the ugly

A little presentation I made to tell other about a technique I really love.

It is based on the wonderful reveal.js framework. Grab your copy [here](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)!

You might also want to take a look at [why-tdd.md](why-tdd.md) which is essentially the markdown version of the whole 
presentation.

## How to install
